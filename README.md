**Graceful Degradation Paragraph**

The idea of graceful degradation is to build the app assuming full capabilities from the user (in this case, good internet), and then add support for users without the modern feature. In this case, service workers help us degrade gracefully by caching important information. This makes sure that the users will have a good experience in this app even if they do not have good internet.
